Lung Cancer Detection using Deep Learning
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based approach for detecting lung cancer using chest CT scan images. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze medical images and aims to assist in the early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Detecting lung cancer in its early stages is crucial for improving survival rates. This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify lung cancer patterns in CT scan images, contributing to more accurate and efficient diagnostic support for radiologists.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Standardized resizing, scaling, and data augmentation to improve model performance and generalization.
Model Selection: Implemented and compared two CNN-based models, including a custom ResNet-inspired architecture.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluated model performance based on accuracy, with visualization for performance tracking.
Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing includes CT scan images of lungs, divided into categories based on the presence or absence of lung cancer. The dataset is organized into train, validation, and test directories. Ensure the dataset follows this structure:


Installation and Dependencies
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Structure
data_preprocessing.py: Script for loading, augmenting, and preprocessing the data.
model_definition.py: Contains model definitions, including custom ResNet-inspired CNNs.
train_and_evaluate.py: Script to train the models and evaluate them on the test dataset.
visualizations.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data visualization and performance tracking.


Model Details
This project includes two deep learning models:

ResNet-Inspired CNN: A custom model built from identity and convolutional blocks, inspired by the ResNet architecture.
Custom CNN: An alternative model with convolutional and fully connected layers, aimed at comparing performance and speed.
Training the Models
To train and evaluate the models, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_and_evaluate.py
This script will load the dataset, preprocess the images, and train the models. Evaluation results, including accuracy, are printed at the end of the training.

Results and Analysis
Test Accuracy: Displayed after model evaluation.
Performance plots: Generated for accuracy and loss over the epochs, saved in the output folder.
