Steps for Building the Lung Cancer Detection Project
1. Import Necessary Tools
Imported libraries for handling data, building the model, and evaluating its performance. Examples include TensorFlow for deep learning and Matplotlib for visualizations.

2. Load and Preprocess the Dataset
Loaded a dataset containing lung and colon tissue images categorized into five classes (3 cancerous, 2 non-cancerous).

Rescaled pixel values of images to normalize them.
Augmented the dataset by applying random transformations like rotations and zooms to make the model robust to variations.
Split the dataset into three parts: training, validation, and testing.
3. Explore and Visualize Data
Analyzed the distribution of images across different classes to ensure balance.
Visualized sample images from each class to understand the dataset.
4. Design the CNN Architecture
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into five classes.
Included layers to extract features, reduce overfitting, and stabilize training.
Designed the output layer to provide probabilities for each of the five classes.
5. Compile the Model
Defined how the model learns by choosing an optimizer (Adam), a loss function (categorical crossentropy), and an accuracy metric.

6. Train the Model
Trained the CNN using the training dataset.
Monitored the model's performance on the validation dataset to avoid overfitting.
Used early stopping to terminate training when no further improvements were observed.
7. Evaluate the Model
Measured the model's accuracy and loss on the test dataset to assess its performance.
Generated a classification report to evaluate metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score for each class.
Visualized the confusion matrix to understand where the model performed well or struggled.
8. Visualize Training Progress
Plotted graphs for training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs to evaluate the model's learning behavior.

9. Simplify Output for the Website
Mapped the five predicted classes into binary outputs ("Cancerous" or "Non-Cancerous") for user-friendly results.

10. Document Results and Future Plans
Documented the modelâ€™s high accuracy and performance.
Proposed future improvements like adding rare cancer types, using advanced pre-trained models, and scaling up the deployment.
